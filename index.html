					<blockquote> "The program and the research projects at George Brown helped me learn various aspects of interaction design and look at the problems from various angles. I have gained vast knowledge not only in interaction design but also in human-centered design. George Brown helped me break the shell and encouraged me to be a leader in finding better design solutions." </blockquote>
